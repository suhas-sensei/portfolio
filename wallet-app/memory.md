# Project Requirements & Memory

## Initial Request
- Create a Next.js project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- Implement a wallet component with:
  - ETH/USD price display
  - Animated chart visualization
  - Prize pool and payout information
  - Bottom navigation
  - Yellow card design

## Swipe Animation - COMPLETED
- Add Bumble-style swipe animation to the main yellow card
- Card contains:
  - ETH/USD text
  - Price ($41,812.14)
  - Graph/chart
  - Next round info
  - Payout details (Down 1.5x, Up 2.5x)
- **Fixed elements (DO NOT move):**
  - Top icons (Avatar, Search, Bell)
  - Bottom navigation bar
- **Swipeable element:**
  - Only the yellow card should swipe right or left
- **Important constraints:**
  - Do NOT change the design
  - Do NOT make textual changes
  - Do NOT add any content
  - Only add swipe functionality

## Card Stack System - COMPLETED (v1)
- Implement a stack of cards (numbered 1 to n)
- When the current card is swiped away (right or left):
  - It fades/flies away in that direction
  - The card underneath (card 2, 3, 4, etc.) takes its place
  - This continues for multiple cards in sequence
- All cards have the same content
- Cards are stacked on top of each other
- Only the top card is swipeable

## Endless Cards + 2D Look - COMPLETED
- Make cards endless - keep generating new cards infinitely
- Remove 3D rising effect when swiping away cards
- Make the transition solid and 2D (sophisticated and smooth)
- Cards should appear flat, not scaled or translated vertically
- Keep the opacity for depth but remove scale/translateY effects

## Magnet Pull-Away Effect - COMPLETED
- Variable tempo/speed for card movement during swipe
- Card follows finger movement until halfway out of screen
- After halfway point: magnet effect pulls card away automatically
- Card should not be visible after it exits the 16:9 screen box
- Effect should be subtle and smooth, not harsh
- Project is designed for phone screen (vertical mobile view)

## Swipe Feedback Icons - COMPLETED (Bumble Style)
- Add visual feedback icons when swiping (like Bumble)
- **Right swipe:** Green circle with up arrow rises from right edge
- **Left swipe:** Red circle with down arrow rises from left edge
- Icons appear/rise at the same pace as the card is swiped
- Card only vanishes when icons are completely visible and entire body is out of screen edges
- After icons are fully visible, both card and icon vanish instantly
- Animation speed reduced by 50% (0.4s magnet pull, 0.6s spring-back)
- Icon opacity reduced to 60% maximum for subtlety

## Card Weight/Resistance - COMPLETED
- Cards feel too sensitive and light to touch
- Add weight/resistance to make them feel more substantial
- Small finger movements shouldn't move cards easily
- **Implementation:**
  - Drag coefficient of 0.5 (card moves at half speed of finger)
  - Adjusted threshold to 80px to match new drag behavior
  - Icons scale/fade based on new threshold

## Prevent Text Selection - COMPLETED
- Text was being selected during swipe gestures
- Added `select-none` class to prevent text selection
- Applied to both main container and card elements
- Users can now swipe smoothly without accidentally selecting text

---

# PHASE 2: Vertical Scrolling (Reels-Style)

## Vertical Market Scrolling - COMPLETED
- Add vertical scroll feature like Instagram/TikTok reels
- Scroll down to see different market cards (ETH/USD, BNB/USD, etc.)
- Each market card is a complete independent card with:
  - Its own token name (ETH, BNB, etc.)
  - Same exact design and functionality as Phase 1
  - Independent left/right swipe functionality
  - Own endless card stack
  - Same green/red swipe indicators
  - Same weight and animations
- **Markets implemented:**
  - ETH/USD
  - BNB/USD
- **Implementation:**
  - Created MarketCard component with marketName prop
  - WalletValue is now a vertical scroll container
  - Platform-aware navigation:
    - **Mobile devices**: Touch scrolling with momentum (TikTok/Reels style)
      - CSS scroll snap (`snap-y mandatory`, `snap-stop: always`)
      - Touch momentum scrolling (`WebkitOverflowScrolling: touch`)
      - Auto-snap to nearest card after scroll ends (150ms debounce)
      - Hidden scrollbars with `scrollbar-hide` utility
    - **Desktop/Laptop**: Navigation arrows
      - Cute up/down chevron buttons positioned outside 16:9 frame
      - Arrows appear only on desktop (width >= 768px or non-mobile user agent)
      - Up arrow shows when not on first market
      - Down arrow shows when not on last market
      - Smooth scroll animation on click
      - White circular buttons with hover effects
      - Positioned 60px above/below the card frame
  - Each market maintains independent state
  - Platform detection via user agent and window width

## Responsive Design - COMPLETED
- Fixed layout issues on all devices
- Container now fills entire viewport (100vh/100vw)
- Prevents content cropping on mobile devices
- Scales properly on desktop/laptop
- **Mobile (< 768px):**
  - Smaller text sizes (text-3xl instead of text-5xl)
  - Reduced padding and spacing
  - Smaller icons and buttons
  - Container width: max-w-md (448px)
  - Optimized for phone screens
- **Tablet/Desktop (>= 768px):**
  - Larger text sizes
  - More padding and spacing
  - Full-size icons
  - Container width: max-w-xl (576px) - 1.29x wider than mobile
  - More comfortable viewing on laptop screens
- **Viewport configuration:**
  - Fixed html/body to prevent scrolling issues
  - Proper viewport meta tags (width=device-width, initial-scale=1)
  - User scaling disabled for app-like experience
  - Viewport-fit: cover for full-screen
- **Mobile Browser Chrome Fix (JavaScript + CSS):**
  - Created `useViewportHeight` hook using `window.visualViewport`
  - Listens to resize and scroll events to track real-time viewport changes
  - Updates height dynamically when Chrome address bar shows/hides
  - Responds to orientation changes
  - Falls back to `window.innerHeight` if visualViewport not available
  - **Safe area insets implementation:**
    - Header: `calc(1rem + env(safe-area-inset-top, 0px))`
    - Bottom nav: `calc(1rem + env(safe-area-inset-bottom, 0px))`
    - Spacers adjusted to account for safe areas
    - Works with iPhone notches and Android gesture bars
  - Prevents cropping on all modern phones with browser chrome

## Fixed UI Layer - COMPLETED
- Header and bottom navigation moved to top-level container
- **Architecture:**
  - Header (avatar, search, bell) now in WalletValue component
  - Bottom navigation now in WalletValue component
  - Both have z-index: 50 (above all cards which are z-10-15)
  - Cards no longer contain header/nav elements
- **Behavior:**
  - Header and nav remain fixed during card swipes
  - Cards slide underneath the fixed UI elements
  - Proper pointer-events handling (pointer-events-none on container, pointer-events-auto on buttons)
  - Safe area insets maintained at container level
- **Result:**
  - Professional app-like experience
  - UI elements never move during interactions
  - Clean separation of fixed vs swipeable content

## Card Spacing & Canvas Color - COMPLETED
- Reduced yellow card size to create spacing/distance between cards
- Content inside cards remains the same size
- **Implementation:**
  - Changed cards from `inset-0` to `inset-4 sm:inset-6` (1rem mobile, 1.5rem desktop)
  - Creates visual spacing around each card in the stack
- Changed canvas background color from gray-900 to #27262c (dark charcoal)
- Creates better visual separation between stacked cards
- More sophisticated layered appearance

## Header Alignment with Card Content - COMPLETED
- Aligned top bar (avatar, search, bell) with in-card content
- Header contained within yellow card boundaries while staying topmost layer (z-50)
- **Implementation:**
  - Fixed horizontal positioning: `left: 2rem, right: 2rem` (consistent across all devices)
  - Fixed vertical positioning: `top: calc(2rem + env(safe-area-inset-top, 0px))` (consistent across all devices)
  - Matches card content area: inset (1rem) + padding (1rem) = 2rem from viewport edges
  - Avatar aligns with "ETH/USD" text horizontally
  - Bell icon aligns with card content right edge
  - Header starts below card top edge, properly contained within card
  - No responsive scaling - same spacing on all devices
- Maintains safe area insets for notches/status bars

## Custom Font Implementation - COMPLETED
- Applied Bungee-Regular.ttf font to entire application
- **Implementation:**
  - Moved font file to `app/fonts/Bungee-Regular.ttf`
  - Used Next.js `localFont` API to load custom font
  - Created CSS variable `--font-bungee`
  - Applied to body element in globals.css

- Follows same yellow card design language as the app
- Asks user to commit an amount before continuing
- **Design:**
  - Yellow card (yellow-400 background) with rounded corners
  - Direction indicator (green circle with ↑ for UP, red circle with ↓ for DOWN)
  - Title: "Commit Amount"
  - Subtitle: "Betting UP/DOWN"
  - Amount input field with yellow-500 background
  - Black confirm button with yellow text
  - Disabled state for empty amount
- **Behavior:**
  - Triggered after card exits screen (400ms after swipe threshold)
  - Popup is topmost layer (z-index: 100)
  - Full-screen overlay with backdrop blur
  - Blocks all interactions until amount is committed and confirmed
  - Vertical scrolling disabled while popup is active
  - Popup dismisses on confirm button click
  - User can then scroll to next market
- **Implementation:**
  - Component: `components/commit-popup.tsx`
  - Props: `direction` ("up" | "down"), `onConfirm` callback
  - MarketCard triggers `onSwipeComplete` callback with direction
  - WalletValue manages popup state and displays CommitPopup

  - Plays every time user swipes left or right
  - Audio initialized in useEffect on component mount with preload
  - Sound plays when swipe threshold is reached (magnetized state)
  - Resets to beginning before each play (currentTime = 0)
  - Error handling for audio play failures with retry mechanism
- **Volume Amplification (200% boost):**
  - Web Audio API context with GainNode
  - Base volume set to 1.0 (max browser volume)
  - GainNode.gain.value = 2.0 for 200% amplification
  - MediaElementAudioSourceNode connects audio to gain node
  - Gain node connects to audio context destination
- **Mobile-Specific Fixes:**
  - Audio unlocking for iOS Safari (requires user interaction)

## Bottom Navigation Icon Size Increase - COMPLETED
- Doubled the size of all bottom navigation icons
- Spread icons apart proportionately for better spacing
- **Changes:**
  - Icon sizes increased from `w-4 h-4 sm:w-5 sm:h-5` to `w-8 h-8 sm:w-10 sm:h-10` (2x size)
  - Button padding increased from `p-1.5 sm:p-2` to `p-3 sm:p-4` (proportional)
  - Container spacing changed from `gap-2 sm:gap-3` to `justify-between` (evenly distributed)
  - Container padding increased: `p-2 sm:p-3` → `p-3 sm:p-4` with `px-6 sm:px-8`
  - Bottom navigation spacer: 5.5rem in MarketCard and Profile
  - Ensures yellow card content stops before middle of navbar
  - No content leakage from bottom corners below white navbar
- **Result:**
  - Larger, more touch-friendly navigation icons
  - Better visual hierarchy
  - More breathing room between icons
  - Improved mobile usability
  - Clean content cutoff above navigation bar

## Bottom Navigation Design Update - COMPLETED

  - **Prize Pool Amount**: Increased from text-[10px]/text-xs to text-2xl/text-3xl (bold)
  - **Payout Multipliers (1.5x, 2.5x)**: Increased from text-sm/text-base to text-3xl/text-4xl (bold)
  - Reorganized layout for better readability:
    - Prize pool section separated from payouts
    - "NEXT ROUND" and "PRIZE POOL" as smaller labels
    - "147 CELO" as large, bold focal point
  - **Payout sections**:
    - Down section: Left-aligned
    - Up section: Right-aligned for visual balance
    - "Down"/"Up" as smaller labels
    - Multipliers (1.5x/2.5x) as large, bold numbers with color coding:

  2. Video Console (Markets) - `video-console-stroke-rounded.svg`
  3. Transaction History - `transaction-history-stroke-rounded.svg`
  4. Brain 02 (AI) - `brain-02-stroke-rounded.svg`
- **Implementation:**
  - SVG files copied to `public/icons/` directory
  - Using Next.js Image component for optimized loading
  - Icons maintain same size: `w-8 h-8 sm:w-10 sm:h-10`
  - CSS filters applied for color management:
    - Active state (yellow background): Black icon (`filter:brightness(0)`)
    - Inactive state: Gray icon (complex filter for gray-600 equivalent)
  - All SVGs use `currentColor` for stroke, allowing filter-based coloring
- **Result:**
  - Custom, professional icon set
  - Balanced sizes matching original design
  - Proper color states (black on yellow, gray otherwise)
  - Optimized SVG loading via Next.js Image

## BobaSoda Logo Replacement - COMPLETED
- Replaced GIF with BobaSoda transparent logo in top left corner
- **Implementation:**
  - Logo file: `BobaSoda full logo black transparent bg.png` → `public/bobasoda-logo.png`
  - Using Next.js Image component
  - Size: `h-10 sm:h-12` with `w-auto` (maintains aspect ratio)
  - Dimensions: 150x50 base size (1.25x larger than initial)

# PHASE 5: Round Timer System

## Timer Overlay on Prize Pool Box - COMPLETED
- Added visual timer overlay to create sense of urgency
- **Round System:**
  - Total round duration: 2 minutes (120 seconds)
  - Swipe window: First 40 seconds (swiping allowed)
  - Blocked period: Last 80 seconds (swiping blocked)
  - Timer is global across all token markets
- **Visual Implementation:**
  - Transparent black overlay on prize pool/next round info box
  - Opacity: 0.15 (15%) - mid-level opacity
  - Animates from left to right over 2 minutes
  - Uses width percentage (0% to 100%)
  - Smooth animation with 50ms update interval
  - Overlay positioned absolutely with `overflow-hidden` container
- **Shake Effect (Urgency Amplifier):**
  - Activates from 1:00 to 1:40 (60-100 seconds)
  - Timer progress: 50% to 83.33%
  - Entire prize pool box shakes continuously
  - CSS keyframe animation: horizontal shake (±2px)
  - Animation duration: 0.5s infinite loop
  - Creates heightened sense of urgency as round closing approaches
- **Technical Details:**
  - State: `timerProgress` tracks percentage (0-100)
  - Timer updates every 50ms for smooth visual progress
  - Auto-resets when reaching 100% for continuous rounds
  - Overlay uses `pointer-events-none` to not block interaction
  - Content layered above overlay with `relative z-10`
  - Conditional `animate-shake` class applied during shake period
- **Result:**
  - Visible timer progress without blocking content readability
  - Creates urgency as overlay fills the box
  - Shake effect intensifies urgency during critical period
  - Text remains fully readable through transparent overlay
  - Smooth, continuous animation

## Swipe Blocking After 100 Seconds - COMPLETED
- Blocks all swiping after 100 seconds (1:40) until round resets
- Shows subtle warning overlay when swiping is disabled
- **Implementation:**
  - Block condition: `isSwipeBlocked = timerProgress >= 83.33%`
  - Prevents `handleDragStart` from initiating drag
  - Prevents `handleDragMove` from processing movement
  - Cursor changes to `not-allowed` on blocked cards
- **Warning Overlay:**
  - Centered overlay with backdrop blur
  - Semi-transparent black background (60% opacity)
  - Yellow text: "Round Closed"
  - White subtext: "Wait for next round"
  - z-index: 20 (above cards, below popup)
  - `pointer-events-none` to not block interaction
- **User Experience:**
  - Clear visual feedback that swiping is disabled
  - Subtle, non-intrusive warning message
  - Cursor changes reinforce blocked state
  - Auto-clears when timer resets to 0%
- **Result:**
  - Swiping completely disabled after 1:40
  - Users clearly understand they must wait
  - Clean transition to next round
  - Maintains engagement with timer visibility

## One Swipe Per Token Per Round - COMPLETED
- Users can only swipe once per token per round
- After swiping a token, that specific token is locked until next round
- Other tokens remain swipeable (e.g., swipe ETH, can still swipe BNB)
- **Implementation:**
  - `swipedMarkets` Set in WalletValue tracks which markets have been swiped
  - Passed to MarketCard as `hasSwipedThisRound` prop
  - `onSwipeComplete` callback updated to include marketName parameter
  - When swipe completes, marketName added to swipedMarkets Set
  - `isSwipeBlocked` now checks: `timerProgress >= 83.33 || hasSwipedThisRound`
  - Timer reset callback clears all swipe tracking for new round
- **User Feedback:**
  - Warning overlay shows context-aware messages:
    - "Already Swiped" / "One swipe per round" - when user has swiped this token
    - "Round Closed" / "Wait for next round" - when timer expired
  - Cursor shows `not-allowed` on blocked cards
  - Drag handlers prevent interaction when blocked
- **Round Lifecycle:**
  - Round starts (0:00): All tokens swipeable, swipedMarkets = empty
  - User swipes ETH: ETH added to swipedMarkets, ETH now blocked
  - User can still swipe BNB (different token)
  - Timer hits 1:40 (100s): All remaining tokens blocked by time
  - Timer hits 2:00: Reset occurs, swipedMarkets cleared, all tokens swipeable again
- **Result:**
  - One swipe per token per round enforced
  - Clear visual feedback for blocked state
  - Smooth reset for new rounds
  - Independent tracking per token
